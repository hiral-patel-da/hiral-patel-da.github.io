Project Goal - 
To gather and analyze salary information from around the world for jobs in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. This dataset will show how much people in these fields earn based on their job, industry, location, and experience level. The goal is to provide clear, useful insights that help companies, employees, and policymakers understand and improve pay practices in AI, ML, and data science globally.

Tasks - 
* Clean and Prepare data - 

    1) select all the field and remove duplicates found in the data.


    2) To better understand the data, let's replace the data for experience_level, employment_type, company_size. (Make sure other columns doesn't get change)


    3) Format salary_in_usd column by adding comma and zero decimal place.

* Data Exploration - 

    1) Pivot table - Look for trends 

    2) Analyze Data - Analyze the dataset to identify salary trends and patterns across different variables (job role, industry, location, experience).
    * Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, range) and visualize data using charts and graphs.

    3) Prepare a detailed report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.
    * Create visualizations to present salary data and trends effectively.

    4) Share your findings in reports or online so everyone can use them to understand salary trends in these fields.

* Findings -

    1) Distribution of Top 10 Job titles

    2) Salary by Employment type

    3) Salary vs Employee Residence

    4) Top 10 Countries Data Science Employees lives in

    5) Distribution of Data Science job by company location

    6) Top 5 Highest salary by Job title

    7) What are the most common job titles and employment types in the AI, ML, and Data fields?

    8) How does experience level and employment type affect salary in the AI, ML, and Data fields?

    9) How have salaries in the AI, ML, and Data fields changed from 2020 to 2023?

    10) Are there any significant differences in salary trends between different industries or company sizes?

    11) What is the impact of remote work on salary in the AI, ML, and Data fields?
