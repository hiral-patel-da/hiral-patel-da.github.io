Project Goal
====

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data to uncover insights into infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and their implications on public health and healthcare systems globally.

Objectives
====

- Exploration of COVID-19 Data: Analyze trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different continents and countries to identify patterns and variations.

- Mortality Analysis: Investigate the relationship between total cases and deaths to understand mortality rates and assess the severity of the pandemic's impact in various regions.

- Infection and Vaccination Impact: Evaluate the percentage of population infected with COVID-19 and the progress of vaccination campaigns to gauge the effectiveness of public health responses.

- High Infection Rate Identification: Identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population size to highlight areas of significant COVID-19 spread.

- Regional Comparison: Compare continents to identify those with the highest mortality rates per population, providing insights into regional disparities and impacts.

Findings
===

- Mortality Patterns: Variations in mortality rates indicate differing impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and public health measures across countries.

Solution
====
This project involves querying and analyzing data from the "CovidDeaths" and "CovidVaccinations" tables within the COVID-19 database. Utilizing SQL queries, views, and temporary tables, the project aims to store and visualize data for deeper analysis and presentation of findings. By focusing on infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress, this exploration seeks to provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers to enhance COVID-19 response strategies globally.
