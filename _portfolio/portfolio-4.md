# Project Goal

To analyze and visualize the Seattle Airbnb listings dataset from 2016 to uncover insights into pricing trends, geographic patterns, and accommodation preferences, ultimately providing actionable insights for stakeholders in the hospitality industry.

# Live Dashboard

The live dashboard can be viewed at the following link: <https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hiral.patel6427/viz/FactorstoforwhenBuyingAirbnb/Story1>


# Objectives

1. Explore Pricing Dynamics:

    * Understand how Airbnb listing prices vary based on factors such as property size (number of bedrooms) and location (zipcode).

2. Geographic Analysis:

    * Identify spatial patterns in Airbnb pricing across different neighborhoods in Seattle using both bar graphs and interactive maps.

3. Seasonal Revenue Analysis:

    * Analyze seasonal variations in Airbnb revenue throughout 2016 to discern peak demand periods and their impact on pricing.

4. Accommodation Preference:

    * Determine the distribution and popularity of different types of accommodations (number of bedrooms) to understand market demand and host preferences.

# Approach

### Data Visualization Approach:

* Tool Utilization: Tableau Public for creating interactive dashboards that visually represent findings through bar graphs, maps, and line charts.

* Dashboard Components: Develop a comprehensive dashboard featuring:

    - A bar graph showing average prices by number of bedrooms.

    - A map visualization pinpointing average prices by zip code.

    - A line chart illustrating revenue trends across the year.

    - A table highlighting the distribution of listings by number of bedrooms.

* Interactivity: Enable hover-over capabilities on the map for detailed zip code and price information, enhancing user engagement and understanding.

* Insightful Presentation: Provide clear annotations and insights alongside visualizations to facilitate understanding of key trends and patterns.

# Findings

1. Pricing Dynamics:

    * Larger properties with more bedrooms tend to command higher prices, indicating pricing strategies based on capacity and perceived value.

2. Geographic Analysis:

    * Certain zip codes in Seattle exhibit higher average Airbnb prices, reflecting differences in neighborhood desirability and amenities.

3. Seasonal Revenue Patterns:

    * Prices typically peak during tourist-friendly months (e.g., spring and summer) and holiday seasons (e.g., December), correlating with increased demand.

4. Accommodation Preference:

    * Single-bedroom listings constitute the majority, suggesting a preference for smaller, potentially more affordable accommodations among travelers.

    
# Conclusion

Through comprehensive data visualization of the 2016 Seattle Airbnb listings dataset, this project has uncovered valuable insights into pricing dynamics, geographic trends, seasonal revenue patterns, and accommodation preferences. The findings highlight the influence of property size and location on pricing, seasonal fluctuations in demand, and the popularity of smaller accommodations. By leveraging Tableau for interactive dashboards, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize pricing strategies and cater to market preferences effectively in Seattle's dynamic hospitality sector.
