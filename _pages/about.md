# About Me

Hello! My name is Hiral Patel, and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Psychology. My interest in understanding patterns and trends has inspired me to explore into data analysis, where I can blend my analytical skills with my curiosity for uncovering insights.

Over the past few months, I have dedicated myself to learning essential tools for a Data Analyst role, including Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I have completed several projects that demonstrate my ability to analyze data, visualize findings, and provide actionable insights. You can view the projects in the portfolio sections.

I am eager to gain hands-on experience and am actively seeking internship opportunities, to further develop my skills and contribute to a dynamic team. I am enthusiastic about the potential to bring value to an organization through data-driven decision-making.

Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities.
