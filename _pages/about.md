# About Me

I am a Bachelor of Psychology graduate with a strong passion for data analysis and a knack for statistical methods, research, and data manipulation. Proficient in tools such as Tableau, SQL, and Excel, I thrive at converting raw data into valuable insights and engaging visual representations.

My journey in psychology has equipped me with a rigorous approach to research and analysis, emphasizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. I am adept at interpreting complex datasets to uncover patterns and trends, which allows me to derive actionable recommendations.

Driven by a desire to apply my analytical skills in a dynamic environment, I am eager to transition into a data analyst role where I can leverage my expertise in data visualization and statistical analysis. I thrive in collaborative settings, where my strong communication skills and collaborative mindset enable me to effectively communicate insights and collaborate with diverse teams.

Currently expanding my knowledge through continuous learning in advanced statistical methods and data science techniques, I am committed to enhancing my capabilities and making a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making.
